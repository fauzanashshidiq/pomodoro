##  Mission Brief
**POMO-GEAR** isn't just a timer; it's a productivity cockpit designed for those who appreciate the tactile feel of successful work. Inspired by vintage comic tech and industrial design, this application blends the classic Pomodoro Technique with a distinct "Retro-Future" aesthetic.

Whether you're debugging code, writing a novel, or studying for finals, **POMO-GEAR** keeps your engine running smooth.

##  Key Features

###  The Chronometer
*   **Tri-Mode Timer**: Seamlessly switch between **Focus (25m)**, **Short Break (5m)**, and **Long Break (15m)** protocols.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Hard-edged, high-contrast display ensures you never lose track of time.
*   **Auto-Reset**: Timer intelligently resets to the correct duration when switching modes.

###  Mission Control (Task Management)
*   **Active Target Selection**: Click any task to lock it in as your **Primary Objective**. The timer display updates to keep you focused on *one thing at a time*.
*   **Auto-Logging**: Successfully completing a Pomodoro session automatically increments the session count for your active task. No manual data entry required.
*   **Persistent Memory**: All missions and stats are saved locally. Your progress survives browser refreshes.
*   **Tactile Interactions**: Buttons and cards feature satisfying "hard shadow" press effects.

    *   Custom `retro-` color palette.
